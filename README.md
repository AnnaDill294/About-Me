# Personal Statement: 
When I was a kid, I had a pet parakeet named [Tinkerbell](https://t3.ftcdn.net/jpg/08/49/26/80/360_F_849268054_rYtzxkbxvcr6y3F0kz3VskMIJxWVAQN1.jpg). Inspired by that experience, I created this website to help parakeet owners design the perfect habitat for our feathered friends!

# Research Interests: Parakeet Habitat Optimization Software 
My company plans to develop user-friendly software using html that gathers and analyzes data on optimal parakeet living environments. This data will be sourced from pet owner surveys, environmental factors, and parakeet health statistics. The software will provide personalized habitat recommendations based on user inputs, such as local weather conditions, cage size, and available resources. In the future, we plan to develop a mobile app, enabling parakeet owners to access these insights conveniently while on the go

# Who is Anna Dill? A brief biography:
I live with my parents and two of my three brothers in PA. I was born in Germany; I moved to the US with my mom when I was a baby. I am now 22 years old attending small liberal arts college. My POE is biochemistry and I am trying to go to medical school- although I'm not sure what kind of doctor I want to be. I'm involved in JC Rotaract Club and JC Health Professions Orgnization (HPO). I love hanging out with my friends and being outside. I'm also a grandma when it comes to technology, so I'm really excited to be learning how to make a website!

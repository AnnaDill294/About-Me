About Me - IT105 Project

# Who is Anna Dill?
I am from Ebensburg, PA. I live with my parents and two of my three brothers. I was born in Germany; I moved to the US with my mom when I was a baby. I am now 22 years old attending Juniata College. My POE is biochemistry and I am trying to go to medical school- although I'm not sure what kind of doctor I want to be. I'm involved in clubs like JC Rotaract Club and HPO. I love hanging out with my friends and being outside. I'm also a grandma when it comes to technology, so I'm really excited to be learning how to make a website!
